    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Braddus,</p>
    <p>I am pleased to know your names now and the name of the young blood you have brought to me. You certainly say their names often. Is [she] the artist in the family?</p>
    <p>657 Boulevard is anxious for you to move in. It has been years and years since the young
        blood ruled the hallways of the house. Have you found all of the secrets it holds yet?
        Will the young blood play in the basement? Or are they too afraid to go down there
        alone? I would [be] very afraid if I were them. It is far away from the rest of the
        house. If you were upstairs you would never hear them scream.</p>
    <p>Will they sleep in the attic? Or will you all sleep on the second floor? Who has the
        bedrooms facing the street? Iâ€™ll know as soon as you move in. It will help me to know
        who is in which bedroom. Then I can plan better.</p>
    <p>All of the windows and doors in 657 Boulevard allow me to watch you and track you as you
        move through the house. Who am I? I am the Watcher and have been in control of 657
        Boulevard for the better part of two decades now. The Woods family turned it over to
        you. It was their time to move on and kindly sold it when I asked them to.</p>
    <p>I pass by many times a day. 657 Boulevard is my job, my life, my obsession. And now you
        are too Broaddus family. Welcome to the product of your greed! Greed is what brought the
        past three families to 657 Boulevard and now it has brought you to me.</p>
    <p>Have a happy moving in day. You know I will be watching.</p>
