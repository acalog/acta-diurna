    <p>You wonder who The Watcher is? Turn around idiots. Maybe you even spoke to me, one of the
        so called neighbors who has no idea who The Watcher could be. Or maybe you do know and
        are too scared to tell anyone. Good move. I walked by the news trucks when they took
        over my neighborhood and mocked me. I watched as you watched from the dark house in an
        attempt to find me â€¦ Telescopes and binoculars are wonderful inventions. 657 Boulevard
        survived your attempted assault and stood strong with its army of supporters barricading
        its gates. My soldiers of the Boulevard followed my orders to a T. They carried out
        their mission and saved the soul of 657 Boulevard with my orders. All hail The
        Watcher!!!</p>
    <p>Maybe a car accident. Maybe a fire. Maybe something as simple as a mild illness that
        never seems to go away but makes you fell sick day after day after day after day after
        day. Maybe the mysterious death of a pet. Loved ones suddenly die. Planes and cars and
        bicycles crash. Bones break.</p>
