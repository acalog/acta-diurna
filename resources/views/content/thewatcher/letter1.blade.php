    <p>Dearest new neighbor at 657 Boulevard,</p>
    <p>Allow me to welcome you to the neighborhood.</p>
    <p>657 Boulevard has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its
        110th birthday, I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming.
        My grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is
        now my time. Do you know the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the
        walls of 657 Boulevard? Why are you here? I will find out.</p>
