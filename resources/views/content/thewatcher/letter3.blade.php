<blockquote class="quote-letter">
    <p>657 Boulevard is turning on me. It is coming after me. I donâ€™t understand why. What spell
        did you cast on it? It used to be my friend and now it is my enemy. I am in charge of
        657 Boulevard. It is not in charge of me. I will fend off its bad things and wait for it
        to become good again. It will not punish me. I will rise again. I will be patient and
        wait for this to pass and for you to bring the young blood back to me. 657 Boulevard
        needs young blood. It needs you. Come back. Let the young blood play again like I once
        did. Let the young blood sleep in 657 Boulevard. Stop changing it and let it alone.</p>
