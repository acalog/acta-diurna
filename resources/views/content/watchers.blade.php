                    <p>Sometime in 2015, it was reported that something creepy was happening in Westfield, NJ. Mysterious letters were being sent to a young family with eerie and deeply unsettling undertones. The family had just purchased the home in June 2014 and received several of these letters shortly after closing. The Watcher letters are incredibly unsettling and it appeared this family's new house came with a stalker. There was a civil lawsuit, but it was ultimately dismissed in 2019.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the end of it all, the house was sold at a loss in 2019.  For one family, it was a terrifying nightmare playing out in front of the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is the story of the Westfield Watcher, an anonymous author of at least 4 unsettling letters to this young family, seemingly obsessed with, and possessing a deeper knowledge of the house, and my obsession with finding out who wrote and sent those letters…the truth may be the most frightening part of all. </p>
                    <p>It was the Broaddus family, Derek, his wife Maria, their three young children, who purchased the $1.3M home, 657 Boulevard in Westfield, NJ early summer 2014. They received strange letters seemingly targeting them and their new home before they even had the chance to move in. This story is a cautionary tale of moving into a new neighborhood. No matter how safe you feel, you never really know the history you're walking into.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you’re not familiar with the story of the Watcher, I recommend starting <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/the-haunting-of-657-boulevard-in-westfield-new-jersey.html">here</a>. I will be analyzing the history of the property and explaining my theory on who I suspect to be the Westfield Watcher. </p>
                    <h5>The First Letter</h5>
                    <p>June 18, 2014 </p>
                    <blockquote><em>Dearest new neighbor at 657 Boulevard,<br>Allow me to welcome you to the neighborhood.<br>657 Boulevard has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its 110th birthday, I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming. My grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is now my time. Do you know the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard? Why are you here? I will find out.
                        </em></blockquote>
                    <p>The history of 657 Boulevard appears to be very important to the Watcher, so what made this house so alluring?</p>
                    <blockquote>Owners of 657 Boulevard:<br>1905-1914: Russell<br>1914-1951: Davies<br>1951-1955: Bird
                    <br>1955-1963: Schaffer<br>1963-1990: Bakes<br>1990-2014: Woods<br>2014-2019: Broaddus</blockquote>
                    <h5>History of 657 Boulevard</h5>
                    <p>657 Boulevard is a part of Slope Park, a residential development established by the Westfield Realty Improvement Company in 1904. It was built in 1905 and is a classic Dutch Colonial Revival, a popular architectural style of the early 20th century. The most prominent features of the house are the gambrel facade and roof, asymmetry of the windows, and the front porch. The front-facing, center gambrel roof-line was a popular feature in American architecture roughly between 1895-1915, befitting for the era.
                    </p>
                    <p>From the outside, it is a beautiful example of early 20th century domestic architecture and a reminder of Gilded Age wealth in America.  Boulevard is a quiet, unassuming tree-lined street, with large and well kept houses and yards. It is seemingly a perfect street, in a perfect home, in a perfect neighborhood and in close proximity to New York City. It appears that in Westfield, NJ Boulevard was the street to live on. </p>
                    <p>The original owner of 657 Boulevard was Harry Lincoln Russell, a real estate agent, and his family. They appear to have owned the property between 1905-1914. Russell appears to have been an early property developer in Westfield.
                    </p>
                    <p>The next owners of 657 Boulevard were the Davies family. This family would be the most prominent and longest owners of the property.
                    </p>
                    <p>William H. Davies became mayor of Westfield in 1933 while living on Boulevard. He also died there in 1947 (as did his mother-in-law in 1915 and his wife in 1948). 657 Boulevard was then passed to their son, Ernest Davies and his family. Ernest sold it to Dillard E. Bird in 1951. There is a trend in Westfield of property transferring for $1 and 657 Boulevard was no exception to this tradition until 1990, when the property was sold to the Woods. </p>
                    <p>After the Bird family, the house sold three more times before being purchased by the Broaddus’ in 2014.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Watcher Letter #2</h5>
                    <p>July 18, 2014</p>
                    <blockquote><em>657 Boulevard is anxious for you to move in. It has been years and years since the young blood ruled the hallways of the house. Have you found all of the secrets it holds yet? Will the young blood play in the basement? Or are they too afraid to go down there alone? I would [be] very afraid if I were them. It is far away from the rest of the house. If you were upstairs you would never hear them scream.<br>Will they sleep in the attic? Or will you all sleep on the second floor? Who has the bedrooms facing the street? I’ll know as soon as you move in. It will help me to know who is in which bedroom. Then I can plan better.<br>All of the windows and doors in 657 Boulevard allow me to watch you and track you as you move through the house. Who am I? I am the Watcher and have been in control of 657 Boulevard for the better part of two decades now. The Woods family turned it over to you. It was their time to move on and kindly sold it when I asked them to.<br>I pass by many times a day. 657 Boulevard is my job, my life, my obsession. And now you are too Broaddus family. Welcome to the product of your greed! Greed is what brought the past three families to 657 Boulevard and now it has brought you to me.<br>Have a happy moving in day. You know I will be watching.
                        </em></blockquote>
                    <p>The second letter the family received, a month after the first, was much longer...and much more unsettling than the first. What was the Watcher planning? Why call children “young blood?” Why would you track someone in their own home unless there was a nefarious motive?</p>
                    <p>Taking a step back, If you just purchased a new home and started receiving letters like this, how would you feel? </p>
                    <p>Obviously the Broaddus family was deeply unsettled by the Watcher after receiving these anonymous letters. As it turned out, the family they purchased 657 Boulevard from, the Woods, also received a strange letter, but didn’t think much of it.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is where the story of the Watcher takes an unfortunate turn that had real-life consequences. In 2014(?) The Broaddus family sued the Woods family. They would have never purchased 657 Boulevard had they known about the “Watcher.”<br><br>
                        The Broaddus family went to the Police. Then Detective Lieutenant Leonard Lugo, later demoted to Sergeant due to his involvement in a corruption scandal,  Informed the Broaddus family to stay silent on the letters. The police were unable to solve the case and the Broaddus family, in addition to turning to legal action, turned to security for protection. Now, the family not only has an emotional burden due to the letters, there is now a financial burden building as well.<br><br>
                        There was some speculation on neighbors...specifically focusing on another house on Boulevard, not behind the property.<br>
                        Peggy Langford owned the house next to (right of) 657 Boulevard and had been there since the mid-1960s. . She was in her 90s years old and shared the home with several of her children, who were in their 60s and seemingly a bit eccentric, according to neighbors. Her family was considered as suspects, but were cleared when DNA taken from one of the Watcher letters did not match anyone in the family. The DNA found was to be female.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Watcher Letter #3</h5>
                    <blockquote><em>657 Boulevard is turning on me. It is coming after me. I don’t understand why. What spell did you cast on it? It used to be my friend and now it is my enemy. I am in charge of 657 Boulevard. It is not in charge of me. I will fend off its bad things and wait for it to become good again. It will not punish me. I will rise again. I will be patient and wait for this to pass and for you to bring the young blood back to me. 657 Boulevard needs young blood. It needs you. Come back. Let the young blood play again like I once did. Let the young blood sleep in 657 Boulevard. Stop changing it and let it alone.
                        </em></blockquote>
                    <p>In 2017* The Broaddus family, now stuck with a house that had someone claiming to be the “Watcher” literally watching them...the family tried to look for options to recuperate some of the expenses. They tried to take the house, which is situated on two lots, down and subdivide the property. This was ultimately denied by the city of Westfield.</p>
                    <h5>Watcher Letter #5</h5>
                    <p>March 2017</p>
                    <blockquote><em>You wonder who The Watcher is? Turn around idiots. Maybe you even spoke to me, one of the so called neighbors who has no idea who The Watcher could be. Or maybe you do know and are too scared to tell anyone. Good move. I walked by the news trucks when they took over my neighborhood and mocked me. I watched as you watched from the dark house in an attempt to find me … Telescopes and binoculars are wonderful inventions. 657 Boulevard survived your attempted assault and stood strong with its army of supporters barricading its gates. My soldiers of the Boulevard followed my orders to a T. They carried out their mission and saved the soul of 657 Boulevard with my orders. All hail The Watcher!!!
                        <br>Maybe a car accident. Maybe a fire. Maybe something as simple as a mild illness that never seems to go away but makes you fell sick day after day after day after day after day. Maybe the mysterious death of a pet. Loved ones suddenly die. Planes and cars and bicycles crash. Bones break.
                        </em></blockquote>
                    <p>These letters clearly got more unsettling and unhinged, and seem to have a veil of threat that increases with each letter. Who is this person? Why are they doing this? I just had to know.
                    </p>
                    <p>I took clues from the Watcher’s letters, and I believe they even self-identify in the 4th letter: “Turn around idiots”</p>
                    <p>This person seems to have a deep connection with Westfield and 657 Boulevard, perhaps even having close personal ties to it at some point in time. They also appear to be older...with some phrasing that seems to come out of an old Hollywood movie “move about the house” reminds me of someone who peaked in the 1960s. This person also seems to have some jealousy issues as well as other underlying disturbances.
                    </p>
                    <p>We no longer live in a society where one can easily bully the way to power or play the nepotism game without leaving a trace. Hiding and moving evil deeds around only adds to the narrative and further implicates. Time always tells. I am good at picking up broken pieces of a puzzle and putting them back together the best I can. This has gone on far too long and I have more faith in humanity than what we’ve become. It’s time to face some hard truths.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        *Motive, Means, and Opportunity - was the neighbor on Carleton Rd.?
                        <small>*Street number for Carleton Rd.  will not be provided for this article.</small>
                        <small>**Please note, the new residents of Carleton Rd. are not involved in this case.</small>
                    </h5>
                    <p>Is this where the Westfield Watcher lived until 2017? A family lived here for nearly 50 years before selling it to an LLC in 2017. It was purchased by a couple in 2019. You can see 657 Boulevard from Carleton Rd.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a stucco-clad, Colonial Revival style house built in 1920. While lovely, the homes on Carleton are not as grand as the homes on Boulevard. Between the house on Carleton and 657 Boulevard, there are approximately XX feet between them. Records indicate the owners of this house on Carleton had been there since September 1970 and sold the house in June 2017 to an LLC. That means this couple was living at this house on Carleton at the time the Watcher letters were sent. The couple living there were in their late 80s.</p>
                    <p>
                        That couple raised 10 children at the house on Carleton Rd., the one behind 657 Boulevard. Their children went to Westfield High School and today are grown with families of their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is not mentioned, nor is apparent, besides the access from this house on Carlton Rd. to 657 Boulevard, is that one of their daughters married one of the Bakes’ sons in 1982...The Bakes family lived in 657 Boulevard between 1963-1990. It was the Bakes who sold the house to the Woods. For a time, the Bakes and the family on Carleton Rd. overlapped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That suggests the owners of the house on Carleton Rd. would have had access to 657 Boulevard for nearly a decade if not longer...and a personal connection if her son-in-law grew up there. The matriarch of the house on Carleton Rd. had likely been a frequent guest of 657 Boulevard in the past. She also grew up in Westfield, her family had been there possibly as early as the 1920s.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                       Online realtor photographs indicate there is a very clear view of 657 Boulevard from the backyard of 644 Carleton. You can see all the back windows, the sun room, the back entrance, the driveway...You could probably hear and see quite a lot. It is mentioned in numerous reports regarding the Watcher case that suggested contract workers on 657 Boulevard saw the backyard neighbors had lawn chairs facing 657 Boulevard...as if watching it…
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth Watcher letter also clearly states, “Turn around, idiots” as if living behind the Broaddus’ the entire time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Motive - Lifelong Westfield community member, jealousy, curiosity<br>
                        Means - Knowledge of 657 Boulevard, close proximity to 657 Boulevard<br>
                        Opportunity - Backyard neighbor, always around
                    </p>
                    <p>It is not clear why these owners were not investigated as suspects, perhaps because the couple is elderly and don’t seem to fit any profile? Also, as mentioned, they have a large family that seems to be deeply connected to Westfield, NJ. It also appears that there is corruption in the Westfield, NJ police department itself, with the original Detective on the case being demoted due apparent involvement in such activities, that perhaps it just got overlooked?
                    </p>
                    <p>The truth appears to be a jealous neighbor, one with deep, life-long ties to the community. The suspect is an elderly female, a great-grandmother...and perhaps a form of dementia is this account for the unsettling letters? The backyard neighbor had a family connection to 657 Boulevard by way of her daughter and son-in-law, visibility and access of 657 Boulevard and the creepiest part, referencing things that could only be known had the Watcher been within earshot...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In its path, a family was tormented and took a heavy financial toll on this family...loss in value of their property, lawsuits...not to mention the emotional distress placed on the Broaddus family…I often wonder how many people actually knew who was sending the letters the whole time, and why they kept quiet. If the Broaddus family were seen as outsiders... their fate may have been sealed the moment they stepped foot in that house.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People like the Watcher forget that there are real-life consequences to their actions. Some of us want truth and justice for the disturbing behavior of others that impacts the innocent and ultimately ripples deeply throughout society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Is this it? Is this the truth finally revealed? The Watcher was right behind the Broaddus’ the entire time? Not some nutty prankster, but someone who lived in a different time. Perhaps sending threatening letters was something more commonly done in the past? Remember, actions have consequences, what you do will come back to haunt you someday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There appears to be a strange phenomenon of folks thinking they own a particular place simply because they have been there forever. Unfortunately for them, that’s not really how it works and time will reveal deep corruption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only the Westfield Watcher knows the truth. Hopefully this insight highlights the potential suspect and perhaps the Watcher mystery can finally be solved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let me know what you think? Is it possible an elderly neighbor living behind 657 Boulevard be the Watcher? The name of this suspect will not publicly be named here.  I encourage you to draw your own conclusions.
                    </p>
