                        <p id="disclaimer">*Disclaimer:  this is a theory based on conjecture, publicly available records, the location and the nature of the letters. </p>
                        <p>If there is one thing in life that one must learn, it is that actions have consequences. Perhaps not right away, nor are those consequences always apparent, but they exist. Once something has been cast into the universe, it lingers and serves as a record or imprint in time and space. The intention behind those actions can separate us between good and evil.</p>
                        <p>In 2015, reports that something strange was happening to new homeowners in Westfield, NJ. Someone sent mysterious letters to a young family with deeply unsettling messages about their new residence and children, referenced as "young blood." The family purchased the property in June 2014 and started receiving these letters shortly after that. The letters appear to have ceased in 2017, and the family sold the house, having never lived in it.</p>
                        <p>The Watcher letters are disturbing. It appeared the house came with an apparent stalker or someone obsessed with the property. There was a civil lawsuit, but the courts ultimately dismissed it in 2019. The family sold the home at an approximately 30% loss the same year. For one family, the experience they had in Westfield, NJ, was a terrifying nightmare playing out in front of the world. And apparently, no one could solve it, or maybe no one wanted to.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the story of the Westfield Watcher, an anonymous author of at least 4 bizarre and disturbing letters to this young family, seemingly obsessed with, and possessing a deeper knowledge of the house, and my obsession with finding out who wrote and sent those letters…the truth may be the most frightening part of all. This story is a cautionary tale of moving into a new neighborhood. No matter how safe you feel, you never really know the history you're walking into. </p>
                        <p>To my knowledge the Westfield Watcher has never been publicly identified, but was possibly right there the entire time. </p>
                        <p>The Broaddus family, Derek, his wife Maria, their three young children, purchased the $1.3M home, 657 Boulevard in Westfield, NJ early summer 2014. It was their dream house, but quickly turned into a real nightmare. If you’re not familiar with the story of the Watcher, I recommend starting with this article
                            <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/the-haunting-of-657-boulevard-in-westfield-new-jersey.html">here</a>. This is an analysis of the history of 657 Boulevard and the theory of who the potential suspect of Westfield Watcher might be, not the details of the original case. </p>
                        <article class="border-top border-dark mt-3 pt-4">
                            <p>It all seemed too strange to be real, like something out of a horror movie. The letters were unsettling and the Watcher seemed so close, there was an almost supernatural aura to them. For the curious, this case was too intriguing not to dig deeper into and try to solve. The result, however, sheds a light on how we think we know someone and how deep roots in small communities can have drastic consequences. </p>

                            <p>657 Boulevard has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its 110th birthday, I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming. My grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is now my time. Do you know the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard? Why are you here? I will find out.</p>
