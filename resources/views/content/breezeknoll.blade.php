                <article>
                    <p>Sometimes a place appears haunted, even after that place has ceased to exist. There is a certain
                        sadness and shame that lingers in the air, a desire to forget unpleasant things. But obscuring
                        the past only makes it more alluring and mysterious. Perhaps the first family to live in Breeze
                        Knoll was never able to let go of their house . . . and the next family to reside there was
                        doomed from the start.<br><br>
                        Here is the story of two men and their families, living in a small town at the center of one of
                        America's most grizzly 1970s tragedies. Here’s the story of Breeze Knoll of Westfield, New
                        Jersey: a grand estate with a dark past.<br><br>
                        The late 1960s and early 1970s were exciting, tumultuous, and transformational, with
                        revolutionary music, politics, fashion, and television defining the era. A generational clash
                        was unfolding so deep it caused wars at schools, general culture, and even at home. The
                        relationship between teens and parents has always been complex. Still, the medley of strong
                        religious beliefs held by the previous generation, technological advancements, and radical
                        politics seemed to serve as a violent catalyst in a changing America.<br><br>
                        What happens in the past cannot be changed or altered, but our perception of it can. Even after
                        something is destroyed or replaced, the memory of it lives on. However, the more time passes,
                        the more likely the memory will fade.

                    <p>Located on one of the highest points in Westfield, NJ, set approximately 100 feet back on a
                        gentle knoll, sat one of the most attractive homes in town. A 19-room Georgian-style mansion,
                        complete with a music and art room known as the ballroom, which housed a handsome collection of
                        paintings and hosted lovely events and gatherings.<br><br>
                        It was the family home of one of Westfield's prominent community members for nearly 70 years.
                        "Breeze Knoll" was reminiscent of an era where the wealthy intended their estates and legacy to
                        last for generations. The original owner purchased the property around 1895 and died there. It
                        was passed down for three generations before being sold off to an outside family in the summer
                        of 1965.<br><br>
                        When this newcomer family of five purchased the house from the original owners, it needed a bit
                        of work. The house appeared to be a dream home to this family—an opportunity to start with a
                        clean slate and an impressive place. An attic apartment was available for the grandmother to
                        live in, which made it financially viable. They were the last family to live there.<br><br>
                        Breeze Knoll was a classic Colonial Revival architectural style with heavy elements of Georgian
                        features. It was said to be inspired by a Sea Captain’s house from Salem. Built ca. 1895 (exact
                        build dates are not precise), Breeze Knoll was an elegant, three-story dwelling. There was a
                        large yard and cool breezes would pass through the estate, demonstrating how aptly named Breeze
                        Knoll truly was. The Colonial Revival style was popular in American architecture from 1880 until
                        well into the 20th century.<br><br>
                        The most identifiable Georgian features are the classic palladian center window on the second
                        story, the front porch emphasizing the central entryway, visual symmetry, and heavy
                        shutters.<br><br>
                        The exterior was a white facade with dark green shutters. There were a total of 19 rooms and oak
                        flooring throughout the home. There were ten fireplaces; some made from marble and others from
                        hand-carved teak. The house had five baths total, and the first floor had two living rooms, a
                        dining room, a large kitchen with a butler's pantry, and a laundry room.<br><br>
                        A large ballroom, measuring 33’ long and 23’ wide, located at the back of the house, had a light
                        green tinted stained-glass skylight. Underneath the ballroom was a billiard room. The long hall
                        on the second floor had five bedrooms, while the third floor was the servants' quarters
                        containing two bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. The stairway leading to the second floor
                        was an imperial staircase, splitting in two at the top.<br><br>
                        Breeze Knoll has since disappeared, but its brief existence in time tells a remarkable story
                        involving family legacies, “new money”, unattainable goals, social pressures, violence and
                        tragedy. A bit of place-based history within the broader context of the tumultuous 1960s and
                        70s.<br><br>

                    <h3 class="post__subtitle">The First Generation (1895-1936)</h3>
                    <p>
                        John Samuel Agustus Wittke (1847-1936) and his family were the original occupants of the
                        Hillside Avenue Georgian-style mansion. He was a German immigrant who arrived in the United
                        States in 1865 when he was just 18 years old. He briefly lived in NYC before settling in
                        Westfield, NJ, several years later in the 1870s. He was a wealthy manufacturer of business and
                        accounting forms, and lived on Broad Street before purchasing the 22-acre property in 1895. He
                        commuted from Westfield to New York City for nearly all of his career. The parcel resided on the
                        highest hill in town, nearly a mile northwest of Westfield’s center, straddling the town line
                        with neighboring Mountainside, NJ. Wittke and his family became prominent members of Wesfield’s
                        society.<br><br>
                        The Wittke family consisted of John's wife, Phoebe (Cooper) (1844-1929), and their four
                        children: Henrietta (1874-1962), Wellington (1875-1965), Charles (1876-1934), and Gertrude
                        (1880-1953).<br><br>
                        The ballroom was the home's most luxurious feature, though it could not be seen from the street
                        as it was located directly behind the original house. Parties, weddings, events, and special
                        occasions were celebrated there over the years. It had a green-tinted glass skylight, later
                        rumored to be a Tiffany original. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that this was indeed a
                        Tiffiany original or signed by Tiffany. This rumor seems to have started in the 1970s. It was
                        built as an extension, likely between 1900-1905, to host Mr. Wittke's prized art collection and
                        many books.

                    <h3 class="post__subtitle">Second Generation (1914-1961)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Henrietta, the oldest child to John and Phoebe, attended Smith College in Northampton, MA, in
                        the 1890s. She was married to Lee S. Roberts in 1903. However, they were divorced by 1914. At
                        that time, Henrietta, who kept her married name, moved back into Breeze Knoll. Henrietta
                        continued to live and host community events there until her death. She died in neighboring
                        Mountainside on June 27, 1962, just two days before her 88th birthday. She never remarried or
                        had any children but was actively involved with the community in Westfield most of her life.

                    <h3 class="post__subtitle">Third Generation (1938-1965)</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 1938, John Mills Wittke (1911-2004), a grandson of JSA Wittke and son of Wellington Wittke,
                        moved into Breeze Knoll with his wife, Dorothy “Dot” Wittke. They lived there with his Aunt,
                        Henrietta. He established a small business and worked from home there well into the
                        1950s.<br><br>
                        John M. Wittke was born on November 26, 1911, in Summit, NJ, the son of Wellington Wittke. He
                        graduated in 1935 from Union College of Schenectady, N.Y., where he was a member of the Phi
                        Gamma Delta Fraternity. He was a member of the Echo Lake Country Club in Westfield and later
                        served as Commodore of the Bay Head Yacht Club from 1966 to 1968. Sometime in the late
                        1950s/early 1960s, Wittke appears to have purchased neighboring 437 Hillside Ave. but continued
                        to own 431 Hillside until 1965. He would live with his family at 437 Hillside and later at
                        Breeze Knoll Drive, which was established sometime in the 1950s, and is behind the original
                        property.<br><br>
                        In 1955, Jean Whitney, daughter of Gertrude Whitney and George H. Whitney, granddaughter of JSA
                        Wittke, at age 43, moved back into Breeze Knoll following a scandalous incident. It is not clear
                        how long Jean lived at Breeze Knoll and little is known about her life following the incident in
                        1955. She died in Worcester, MA in September 1993. She does not appear to have had any children.<br><br>
                        These last two generations were the last Wittkes to reside in Breeze Knoll. In 1965, the family
                        sold it to a new family that had just moved to town, looking for a fresh start.<br><br>

                    <h3 class="post__subtitle">Timeline of Notable Gatherings at Breeze Knoll</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>October 10, 1906</strong> - The wedding of John and Phoebe Wittke's youngest daughter,
                        Gertrude Mae
                        Wittke, to G. Harold Whitney took place in the ballroom at 6:30 p.m., decorated with potted
                        plants, white lilies, chrysanthemums, pink roses, and smilax.<br><br>
                        The father of the groom, Rev. George H. Whitney performed the ceremony. John Samuel Agustus
                        Wittke gave his daughter away. An orchestra played the strains of the wedding march from
                        "Lohengrin" and nearly 200 guests were present for the special occasion. The bridal party came
                        down the winding staircase and entered the large hall.<br><br>
                        The Whitney family also lived on Hillside Avenue in a neighboring property. Gertrude would go on
                        to live at that house, which was built in 1890 and is still standing today. Tragically, her
                        husband George died on March 9, 1929, in their home at 319 Hillside Ave. He was 46 at the
                        time.<br>
                        <strong>November 24, 1932</strong> - The wedding of Jean Whitney to Carl Wood occurred there on
                        Thanksgiving
                        1932. Jean was the daughter of George Harold and Gertrude Whitney and grew up next door to
                        Breeze Knoll. Her grandfather, John Wittke, gave her away. Jean wore the same wedding gown her
                        mother wore to her wedding in 1906.<br><br>

                        The couple ultimately divorced in 1936. Jean was married and divorced a second time, and had a
                        third engagement that ended in a robbery scandal in 1955. Her new fiance tried to swindle her of
                        a large sum of money, prompting the immediate termination of their engagement.<br><br>
                        <strong>August 26, 1950</strong> - There was a wedding reception at Breeze Knoll for Janet Page
                        Alpers and Vance
                        Richardson following their marriage. The relationship to Henrietta or the Wittke family is
                        unclear, though they were likely cousins or family friends.<br>

                    <h3 class="post__subtitle">Tragic and Unfortunate Events at Breeze Knoll</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>July 25, 1908</strong> - A severe domestic disturbance was reported at Breeze Knoll. In
                        the morning,
                        domestic employee Molly Brown allegedly attacked her employer, Mrs. Wittke, with a heavy piece
                        of kindling wood. It appears that Ms. Brown, in a violent rage, struck Mrs. Wittke over the head
                        repeatedly, giving her four gashes to the head and breaking one of her fingers in the
                        process.<br><br>
                        Groundskeepers and next-door neighbors heard Mrs. Wittke's screams for help and quickly rescued
                        her from the attack. Mrs. Wittke had been alone in the house with the employee when the incident
                        occurred. The Westfield police were dispatched to the residence and took Ms. Brown to police
                        headquarters. Authorities charged Ms. Brown with atrocious assault for nearly murdering her
                        employer.<br><br>
                        Mrs. Wittke was around 66 years old during the attack, while Ms. Brown was only 36. Ms. Brown
                        was later deemed insane by a local doctor and sent to nearby Morris Plains, NJ, home of
                        Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.<br><br>
                        Ms. Brown appears to have worked for the Wittke family for nearly a decade (if not longer)
                        before the attack occurred. She was born in Virginia in 1872 and was of African-American
                        descent. Her fate after the incident is unknown, and it is unclear why she attacked Mrs. Wittke.<br><br>

                        <strong>January 14, 1929</strong> - The first known death at Breeze Knoll was of matriarch
                        Phoebe Wittke. She was
                        87 years old at the time and died after a brief illness, likely in her bed. Her funeral was held
                        at Breeze Knoll shortly after.<br><br>
                        <strong>May 27, 1936</strong> - The subsequent death within Breeze Knoll was patriarch John S A
                        Wittke. In an
                        ironic twist of fate, he died after a fall down the grand staircase and fractured his skull. Mr.
                        Wittke was 88 years old at the time. The accident occurred around 11:45 a.m. Unfortunately, he
                        never regained consciousness and died approximately two hours later, likely downstairs. Mr.
                        Wittke loved his home and was reportedly in good health at the time. It is unclear how Mr.
                        Wittke fell or what may have caused the tragic event.<br><br>

                        In 1965, John Emil List and his wife Helen purchased the 19-room sprawling mansion on Hillside
                        Avenue. John accepted a prestigious job at a Jersey City bank, after working at Xerox in
                        Rochester, NY. Breeze Knoll, set back and landscaped, was apparently Helen's dream home. They
                        moved into the house with their three children, Patricia, Frederick, John, Jr., and John's
                        mother, Alma.<br><br>
                        It was not the family's first move for John's career. The family resided in California, Detroit,
                        and Rochester, before settling in Westfield. John had previously worked for prestigious and
                        growing companies earlier in his career, but seemed to lack the skills necessary for promotion.
                        So he looked elsewhere, always seeking a well-paid position and important-sounding title.
                        Alma moved with the family primarily for financial reasons. She was from Michigan, and her
                        friends and family were still there. She appears to have been incredibly isolated and miserable
                        during her time at Breeze Knoll.<br><br>
                        Helen L. Morris Taylor married Marvin Everett Taylor in 1941 when she was just 16 years old.
                        The couple had two children, Brenda and Kenneth Everette Taylor. Kenneth died at two months old.
                        On April 16, 1951, Marvin was killed in action in North Korea. He was 33 years old and was
                        awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the Korean Service
                        Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean
                        Presidential Unit Citation, and the Republic of Korea War Service Medal. Marvin’s body did not
                        return to the United States until October. Helen buried her husband on October 12, 1951, and
                        just one day later, she met John List at a bowling alley in Newport News, VA, while she was out
                        with her younger sister, Gene.<br><br>

                        John had joined the military in the 1940s and was recalled in 1950 during the escalation of the
                        Korean War. John was well educated and had an MBA. He thought Helen was gorgeous with her tall
                        and slender figure. Helen appeared to have a lazy eye, caused by an accident where ether
                        splashed in her eye during the birth of her first child. Helen was self-conscious about it as
                        she took pride in her appearance and was always well-dressed and stylish.<br><br>
                        John and Helen married just three months after meeting. It was his first marriage. Helen had
                        insisted the couple wed in Baltimore, Maryland. Unbeknownst to John, Helen had contracted
                        syphilis from her first husband when he was in Korea. Maryland did not require a blood test for
                        a marriage license at that time, and thus, Helen was able to keep her secret. John was largely
                        inexperienced with women having grown up a devout Lutheran. Helen was desperate to find a
                        suitable new husband for her and her daughter, Brenda. John List seemed smart and successful and
                        absolutely adored her, and he seemed good enough to fulfill those roles.<br><br>
                        By the time the family had moved to Westfield in 1965, Helen's battle with syphilis had
                        worsened, and she was suffering from cerebral atrophy. She was drinking scotch heavily every day
                        and was dependent on several prescribed pills, such as tranquilizers. She stayed in bed most of
                        the time, often battling debilitating headaches.<br><br>
                        The marriage between John and Helen had ultimately proved disappointing for both. Helen had lost
                        interest in going to church, something fundamental to John and his lifetime of devoutness. Helen
                        berated John, often comparing him to her first husband, who died a war hero. The relationship
                        was undoubtedly strained.<br><br>
                        However, Helen and John had fallen in love with Breeze Knoll. It needed work, but they had hopes
                        of restoring the beautiful home to its former glory. They also saw it as an opportunity to
                        rekindle their marriage.<br><br>
                        @include('modules.figure', ['imgSource' => 'breezeknoll', 'caption' => ''])
                        The reality was that the new position John List had accepted didn't last long. He found himself
                        unable to hold down a job afterward, especially a well-paying job like the one at Jersey City
                        Bank, which initially drew the family to Westfield. He was never able to hold down another
                        suitable position.<br>
                        By the early 1970s, John List found himself working in insurance out of the house, largely
                        unsuccessfully, and struggling to make any payments. By the summer of 1971, List had sold most
                        of the furniture in the home. In addition, he was driving a 1963 Chevrolet that he could not
                        afford to have inspected, and the funds he had been stealing from his mother were almost out. He
                        was also tricking his family into thinking he was going to work, but in reality, he would take
                        the train from Westfield a few stops over and sit and read a newspaper until the end of the
                        working day.<br>
                        In addition, John may have felt not only did he lack control with his career and marriage, but
                        he may have also felt he was losing control of his children. This was in particular of Patricia,
                        who was 16 and interested in the theatre.<br>

                    <h3 class="post__title">The Murders</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the morning of Tuesday, November 9, 1971, John List waited for his children to leave for
                        school. He then remained in his study and waited for his wife Helen to stir. She woke up, went
                        downstairs, and made her morning coffee before he snuck up on her while she was seated at the
                        kitchen table. She turned her head just in time to see her killer. He shot her once. The bullet
                        appears to have gone through her and into the lower kitchen cabinets. After she was dead, John
                        dragged her body into the nearby ballroom across the hall. Helen was 46 years old.<br><br>
                        @include('modules.figure', ['imgSource' => 'helenList', 'caption' => 'Helen List, the first victim of John List.<br>Image: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23081/helen-list'])
                        Next, John went to the third-floor attic apartment, where his 84 year old mother, Alma, lived.
                        She heard the gunshot and grew concerned. Unfortunately, he came up and shot his mother in her
                        kitchen while she was making breakfast. She was looking right at him. List had attempted to move
                        the body but ultimately left her in the third-floor hallway, in a closet area. He indicated she
                        was too heavy to carry.<br><br>
                        @include('modules.figure', ['imgSource' => 'almaList', 'caption' => 'Alma List was the next victim in Breeze Knoll. She was shot and killed in the attic apartment where she lived.'])
                        List then spent the rest of the morning running errands: sending letters to the children's
                        school to let them know they would be out of town visiting family in North Carolina and
                        canceling mail and other deliveries. Finally, he proceeded to empty his and his mother's bank
                        accounts before returning home and eating lunch.<br><br>
                        @include('modules.figure', ['imgSource' => 'patriciaMList', 'caption' => 'Patricia Morris List was the third victim. She was shot in the back entryway of Breeze Knoll. She still had on her coat from outside when she died. '])
                        His 16-year-old daughter, Patricia, came home early from school that day because she wasn't
                        feeling well. Patricia and her brother, Frederick, both had an after-school job at an insurance
                        office, but Patricia had called out sick. When she approached the back entrance, a small doorway
                        near the kitchen, she was shot once in the head by her father. Patricia was the only family
                        member who didn’t see her killer. She was still wearing her leather coat when he dragged her
                        into the ballroom and laid her on top of a sleeping bag, perpendicular to her mother's body.<br><br>
                        @include('modules.figure', ['imgSource' => 'FMList', 'caption' => 'Frederick Michael List, aged 13 (1958-1971), was the fourth victim of his father’s killing spree.'])
                        Next, his 13-year-old son, Frederick, had called the after-school job asking what happened to
                        Pat, unsure why she didn't show up to work that afternoon. When Frederick came home, he too was
                        shot once in the head and dragged into the ballroom, laid next to his sister. <br><br>
                        @include('modules.figure', ['imgSource' => 'JFList', 'caption' => 'John Frederick List, aged 15 (1956-1971), was the final family member to die. He was shot several times due to a misfire and likely tried to fight back, something his father was probably not expecting. '])
                        John Jr., 15, had a soccer game that afternoon. List went down to the school to watch John Jr.
                        play while the rest of the family was dead at home. When they got back to the mansion, he shot
                        John Jr. multiple times. John Jr. was the only family member who seemed to try and fight or
                        escape his killer. He was still wearing his gloves from outside when he died. Again, his body
                        was dragged from the kitchen and into the ballroom, next to his little brother's body.<br><br>

                        @include('modules.figure', ['imgSource' => 'bodies', 'caption' => 'The bodies of Helen, Patricia, Frederick, and John Jr. List in the ballroom of Breeze Knoll.

                        That night John cleaned up the mess, made dinner, and went to his office. There, he wrote a
                        multipage confession to his pastor on a yellow, lined notepad. He left it in a filing cabinet
                        along with the 9mm Steyr handgun and .22-caliber revolver he used to murder his family. It
                        appeared John List had organized his affairs enough to give him time to evade police.<br><br>

                            Dear Pastor Rehnwinkel:
                        </div>
                        <div class="letter__body">
                            I'm very sorry to add this additional burden to your work. I know that what has been done is
                            wrong from all that I have been taught and that any reasons that I might give will not make
                            it right, but you are the one person that I know that, while not condoning this, will at
                            least possibly understand why I felt that I had to do this.<br><br>

                            1. I wasn't earning anywhere near enough to support us. Everything I tried seemed to fall to
                            pieces. True, we could have gone bankrupt and maybe gone on welfare.<br><br>

                            2. But that brings me to my next point. Knowing the type of location that one would have to
                            live in, plus the environment for the children, plus the effect on them knowing that they
                            were on welfare was just more than I thought they could and should endure. I know they were
                            willing to cut back but this involved a lot more than that.<br><br>

                            3. With Pat being so determined to get into acting I was fearful as to what that might do to
                            her continuing to be Christian. I'm sure it wouldn't have helped.<br><br>

                            4. Also with Helen not going to church I knew that this would harm the children eventually
                            in their attendance. I had continued to hope that she would begin to come to church soon,
                            but when I mentioned to her that Mr. Jutze said he wanted to pay her an elder's call she
                            just blew up and said she wanted her name taken off the church rolls. Again, this could only
                            have an adverse result for the children's continued attendance.<br><br>

                            So that is the sum of it. If any one of these had been the condition we might have pulled
                            through, but this was just too much. At least I’m certain that all have gone to heaven now.
                            If things had gone on who knows if this would be the case.<br><br>

                            Of course mother got involved because doing what I did to my family would have been a
                            tremendous shock to her at this age. Therefore, knowing that she is also a Christian, I felt
                            it best that she be relieved of the troubles of this world that would have hit her.<br><br>

                            After it was all over I said some prayers for them all from the hymn book. That was the
                            least that I could do.<br><br>

                            Now for the final arrangements: Helen and the children have all agreed that they would
                            prefer to be cremated. Please see to it that the costs are kept low.<br><br>

                            For mother she has a plot at the Frankenmuth Church Cemetery. Please contact<br>
                            Mr. Herman Schellkas,<br>

                            He's married to a niece of mother's and knows what arrangements are to be made. She always
                            wanted Reverend Herman Zender of Bay City to preach the sermon, but he's not well.<br><br>

                            Also, I'm leaving some letters in your care.<br>
                            Please send them on and add whatever comments you think appropriate.<br>
                            The relationships are as follows:<br>
                            Mrs. Lydia Meyer, mother's sister<br>
                            Mrs. Eva Meyer, Helen's mother<br>
                            Jean Syfert, Helen's sister<br>

                            Also, I don't know what will happen to the books and personal things but to the extent
                            possible I'd like for them to be distributed as you see fit. Some books might go to the
                            school or church library.<br><br>

                            Originally I had planned this for November 1st, All Saints Day, but travel arrangements were
                            delayed. I thought it would be an appropriate day for them to get to heaven.<br><br>

                            As for me please let me be dropped from the congregation rolls. I leave myself in the hands
                            of God's justice and mercy. I don't doubt that he is able to help us but apparently he saw
                            fit not to answer my prayers the way that I hoped they would be answered. This made me think
                            that perhaps it was for the best as far as the children's souls are concerned. I know that
                            many will only look at the additional years they could have lived…but if finally there were
                            no longer Christians what would be gained.<br><br>

                            Also I'm sure many will say "How could anyone do such a horrible thing?" My only answer is
                            it isn’t easy and was only done after much thought.<br><br>

                            One other thing: it may seem cowardly to have always shot from behind, but I didn't want any
                            of them to know, even at the last second, that I had to do this to them.<br><br>

                            John got hurt more because he seemed to struggle longer. The rest were immediately out of
                            pain. John didn't consciously feel anything either.<br><br>

                            Please remember me in your prayers. I will need them whether or not the government does its
                            duty as it sees it. I'm only concerned with making my peace with God, and of this I am

                        John List slept in at Breeze Knoll that night, the corpses of his family in the house with him.
                        The following day, he woke up, turned all the lights on, the temperature down, and turned on the
                        built-in sound system. He left the radio playing on a religious station, which eerily played
                        throughout the house until the day of the discovery. <br><br>
                        The last event at 431 Hillside Ave. Breeze Knoll residence was a big Halloween party Patricia
                        hosted shortly before her murder. She likely invited her high school and theatre friends, and
                        the party was held on Saturday, October 30, 1971. The nearly empty ballroom still had remnants
                        of Pat’s Halloween party forever captured in photos.<br><br>

                        The lights left on at Breeze Knoll started to burn out, and neighbors became concerned. The
                        family hadn't been heard from in nearly a month (29 days, to be exact) before the community
                        learned what happened. Ultimately, Patricia List's theatre instructor, Edwin Illiano, discovered
                        the gruesome scene on December 7, 1971, and called the police. Patricia was close to her theatre
                        instructor and had joined the local acting group earlier that year. It is her interest in acting
                        that alarmed her father. Her instructor hadn’t heard from her and was concerned. <br><br>

                        John List had ample time to plan the murders, getaway, and disappear. But, in his mind, he did
                        the right thing. He put his family out of the isery that was both real and imagined.<br><br>

                        At the time of the murders, John List had three mortgages on 431 Hillside Ave. Two at the First
                        Federal Savings and Loan Association and another at the Suburban Trust Co. of Westfield. He was
                        deep underwater on Breeze Knoll in 1971. The state of the residence when he left was poor, the
                        mansion in disrepair.<br><br>

                        Rumors that the ballroom had a stained-glass ceiling designed by Louis C. Tiffany, if true,
                        would have saved the family from financial ruin at an estimated cost of $100,000. However, there
                        is no evidence that the ballroom contained a Tiffany original, but was instead a light-green
                        colored class. This rumor dates back to approximately 1972. There was no other evidence of this
                        being a Tiffany original, nor any indication that if John List sold the home, he would have been
                        relieved of his dire financial situation.<br><br>

                        John List avoided capture for over 18 years. He was finally caught after being featured on
                        America’s Most Wanted in 1989 and was quickly recognized. His assumed name was now Robert “Bob”
                        Clarke - after a man, he knew from school and had remarried. He was eventually tried and
                        convicted of his crimes and died in prison in 2008.<br><br>

                        The house sat vacant following the tragic discovery of the bodies the previous December. Then,
                        vandals and curiosity seekers were reported to break into the home the same way Ed Illiano and
                        the police did: through the basement window below the ballroom.<br><br>

                        On August 30, 1972, precisely nine months after the brutal murders of the List family, Breeze
                        Knoll burned down in a mysterious fire. At approximately 3:17 AM, the first alarm went out to
                        the HIllside Avenue mansion for the last time. It appears the blaze started in the open center
                        hall, flames spreading quickly.<br><br>

                        It is not too far-fetched to imagine local teenagers, perhaps ones who knew some or all of the
                        List children, broke into the house and started the fire. It was an era of the occult - an
                        interest in witchcraft and other dark magic was common in teens during the 1960s and into the
                        1970s. Considering the time of the event - 3 AM, a.k.a. the "witching" hour - it could have been
                        drunk teens with candles fooling around trying to summon the victims. However, Breeze Knoll was
                        the sixth victim of John List's crime, reportedly costing $43,000 in damages in 1972 (worth
                        approximately $282,000 in 2021).<br><br>

                        After the fire, the plot sat vacant until it sold at a sheriff’s auction for $36,000 in December
                        1972. In 1974, a new house was built in place, set about 50 feet further back from the original
                        but strangely reminiscent of Breeze Knoll. This house is a brick Georgian-style mansion and can
                        barely be seen from the street. The address is still 431 Hillside Ave.<br><br>

                        Wittke built up wealth and an estate, leaving it to his family to symbolize the hard work and
                        legacy he intended to leave behind. Breeze Knoll served one prominent Westfield family for three
                        generations. But, unfortunately, it would only survive three generations before his
                        grandchildren sold it to John List in a run-down condition and for a profit. John List, an
                        outsider, murdered his family and destroyed Breeze Knoll in just six years.<br><br>

                        John List was chasing an American dream and trying to keep up with a lifestyle he could not
                        afford. A profoundly religious man, List found himself backed into several tight corners
                        regarding his finances, family, and faith. It was a clash of generations, expectations,
                        disappointments, and unlivable pressure. Ultimately, his struggle to be successful in life
                        caught up with him in the most violent way imaginable. Quintuple homicide. Then he chose to be a
                        coward. He ran away. He was leaving Breeze Knoll and his murdered family behind. List was backed
                        into many corners, and in his mind, he had no other way out.<br><br>

                        It is the 50th anniversary of the murders. John List failed. He failed his family, a man forever
                        trapped in a 1950s way of life and unable to accept reality. He took the lives of his immediate
                        family, leaving them to be ghosts, forever trapped in the early winter of 1971 in a house that
                        no longer exists, in a town they never fully integrated with.<br><br>
